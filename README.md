# Sort Manager

Sort Manager Java project complete at Sparta Global.

## About

Java 11 project completed during training; task assigned had been to implement different algorithms with a singleton
and factory design pattern. Used Maven to handle dependencies such as JUnit that has been used to test functionality of programmed
software. Have experimented with logging using Log4j.

## Tools used
- JDK 11
- IntelliJ
- JUnit 5
- Log4J
- Git

## Algorithms Covered
- Bubble Sort (Iterative)
- Merge Sort (Recursive)
- Binary Tree (Recursive)

## Topics Used in Project Functionality
- OOP principles
- SOLID principles
- Logging
- Creation patterns
- Unit Testing
- Performance Testing with different loads
- Defined Packages
- Iterations
- Recursions
- Nested Classes
- Enums
- Predefined and Custom Exceptions

## Approach

JUnit has been utilised later in the project after being introduced during training. Once added to the project, a **Test-Driven Development** approach had been used to develop the Binary Tree implementation. This is displayed in the unit tests within the project.
