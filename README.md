# Sort Manager
Sort Manager Java project complete at Sparta Global.

## About
Java 11 project completed during training; task assigned had been to implement different algorithms with a singleton design pattern. Used Maven to handle dependencies such as JUnit that has been used to test functionality of programmed software.  Have experimented with logging using Log4j.

## Algorithms Covered
- Bubble Sort (Iterative)
- Merge Sort (Recursive)
- Binary Tree (Recursive)

## Java Topics
- Iterations
- Recursions
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inner Classes
- Nested Classes
- Enums
- Custom Exceptions
  
## Approach
JUnit has been utilised later in the project after being introduced during training. Once added to the project, a **Test-Driven Development** approach had been used to develop the Binary Tree implementation. This is displayed in the unit tests within the project.
